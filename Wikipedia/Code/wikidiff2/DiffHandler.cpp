It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.\n* The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.\n* A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1999, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey [[wolf]] populations, with the [[dingo]] and [[New Guinea singing dog]] \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.<ref name=wayne1999/> In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[:de:W.

Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' - the New Guinea singing dog - as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> The inclusion of ''familiaris'' and ''dingo'' under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.<ref name=jackson2017/> This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\n:''See further [[Canis lupus dingo#Taxonomic debate \u2014 dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog|Taxonomic debate - dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog]]''\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n<!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the \"Origin of the domestic dog\" page and the \"Gray wolf\" page (sub-heading \"Evolution and relationship with the dog\").

Especially over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern [[dog breeds]] due to [[artificial selection]] by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. Phenotypic variation can include height measured to the [[withers]] ranging from {{convert|15.2|cm}} in the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] to {{convert|76|cm|abbr=on}} in the [[Irish Wolfhound]]; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; [[coat (dog)|coats]] can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.<ref name=\"The Complete Dog\"/> The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.

This influence on human society has given them the [[sobriquet]] \"[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]\".\n\n==Terminology==\n* The term ''dog'' typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.\n* An adult female is a ''bitch''.\n* An adult male capable of reproduction is a ''stud''.\n* An adult female capable of reproduction is a ''brood bitch'', or ''brood mother''.\n* Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are ''pups'' or ''puppies''.\n* A group of pups from the same [[gestation period]] is a ''litter''.\n* The father of a litter is a ''sire''. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.\n* The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.\n* A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1999, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey [[wolf]] populations, with the [[dingo]] and [[New Guinea singing dog]] \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.<ref name=wayne1999/> In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[:de:W.

Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' - the New Guinea singing dog - as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> The inclusion of ''familiaris'' under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.<ref name=jackson2017/> This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\n:''See further [[Canis lupus dingo#Taxonomic debate \u2014 dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog|Taxonomic debate - dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog]]''\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n<!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the \"Origin of the domestic dog\" page and the \"Gray wolf\" page (sub-heading \"Evolution and relationship with the dog\").
